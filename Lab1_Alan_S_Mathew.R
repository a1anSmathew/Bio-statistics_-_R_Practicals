#Question 1.1
x <- (2.7/2) #This will return the quotient
print(x)

#Question 1.2
x <- (2.7 %/% 2) #Floor of the quotient will be returned
print(x) #floor of 1.35, ie. 1 will be returned

#Question 1.3
x <- (10 + 5i/2) #10 is the real part and the imaginary part 5i is divided by 2
print(x) #The sum of real part(10) and imaginary part(2.5i) is returned

#Question 1.4
x <- round(2.5) #When the number is exactly half the way between two integers it is rounded off to the nearest even number
print(x) #Round to even rule is followed

#Question 1.5
x <- round(-2.5) #Round to even rule is followed when the number is half way between the integers
print(x)

#Question 1.6
x <- 2 %/% 4-1 #from the floor of quotient(0) 1 is subtracted
print(x) 

#Question 1.7
x <- 3*2**2 #This is in the form 3*2^2
print(x)

#Question 1.8
x <- 3**2*2 #This is in the form 3^2*2
print(x)

#Question 1.9
x <- 7 %/% 4
print(x)

#Question 1.10
x <- 7 %% 4
print(x)

#Question 1.11
x <- -7 %% 4 #The divident will be set to the lowest integer divisible by the divisor
print(x) #and will return the diffrence between lowest integer and the divident

#Question 1.12
x <- trunc(5.7)
print(x)

#Question 1.13
x <- trunc(-5.7)
print(x)
